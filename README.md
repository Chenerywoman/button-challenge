# CSS Button challenge: frontend project 

This was a CodeNation project to practise using CSS animations.

## Project Brief

The project brief was to create an html page:
* with the CodeNation logo in the centre of the page
    - when the logo is hovered over it spins and changes the background and text colour
* 4 buttons around the logo, linking to:
    - the CodeNation website
    - CodeNation facebook page
    - CodeNation Twitter page
    - CodeNation instagram page
* Each of the buttons to have:
    - a different shape
    - shadows
    - a different animation on each one on hover
    - a change of colour when clicked and after visited
    - a background image with at least two animations

I completed the challenge using two linked pages:
* The first page has the Code Nation logo and the four other buttons
* The second page has a background image with two animations
